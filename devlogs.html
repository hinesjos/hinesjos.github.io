<p id="devlog-text">Hello everyone!<br>
    Recently I've started work on a new project- <i>Untitled Roguelite Game</i>!!! I'm really looking forward to developing a real game in contrast to my previous project, <i>Yummers Donuts</i>. The goal of this project, for now, is to create the gameloop of  roguelite. My main priorities are as follows:<br>
    1. Develop a system to generate floors and rooms similar to Binding of Isaac (start room, key room, and boss room).<br>
    2. Create an upgrades system for the player (permanent upgrades across runs, run-specific upgrades, temporary consumables, etc.).<br>
    3. Make something fun!<br>
    I'm having loads of fun developing this game and truly learning how to make a compelling game loop. Although it isn't anywhere near a MVP, I do have some content to show for.<br></p>

    <p id="devlog-text">This is a very early version of the starting area for the game. I want to have a tower the player enters, a merchant they can exchange permanent currency with, and maybe some other things I haven't thought of yet.</p>

    <p id="devlog-text">This is a very early demo of a type of room to be randomly generated. The enemies inside are selected randomly and spawned at preset nodes. I plan on making the loot random, too. Maybe even tagging some rooms to have upgrades over consumables or currency in them?</p>

    <p id="devlog-text">This is the first enemy I made myself for the game- <b>THE CANNONEER!</b> This guy is a static turret enemy that shoots projectiles at the player, much like the goblin enemy I made. I plan on it being more bulky to account for the lack of movement, and I think it works alongside moving enemies to divide the player's attention and resources. I'm not too much of an art guy but I'm happy with how it turned out!</p>

<p id="devlog-text">Hello and welcome to GUNK MONKEY, my personal showcase and devlog for all projects related to game design.<br>
    The main goal of this website is to provide myself the intrinsic value something like LinkedIn can't. I'm looking forward to developing a real portfolio through this website not only to show off my wicked programming skills but to create a timeline of sorts to reflect on. Enjoy!</p>
