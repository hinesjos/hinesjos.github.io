<p id="devlog-text">Yummers Donuts is the first game I've ever made for S&box. In fact, it is the first game I've ever made.<br>
    Although Yummers Donuts is an incomplete, simple, spaghetti-coded mess, it's something that showed me I can make a game. Following tutorials from <i>Smallfish</i> and using the S&box Discord server for countless questions I had along the way, I was able to learn how to make a game and was able to publish it for others to play.<br>
    The game itself is a simple infinite runner where you eat donuts and avoid apples. The game speeds up over time, offering power-ups such as Soda to increase health and Jordans to increase player speed for a short amount of time. There's a high score system and a basic game loop and that's all there is to it.</p>

<p id="devlog-text">Although Yummers Donuts isn't anything special, it helped me learn how to make games and it provided me an invaluable (albeit messy) code base that's been vital in developing other projects.</p>
